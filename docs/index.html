<h1>
    Features
</h1>
<p>
    The main feature of this extension is being able to pick from a selection of cursors to customise your browsing
    experience.<br>
    The cursors availible are shown above.<br>

</p>
<h1>
    Usage
</h1>
<p>
    <b>To use this extension, you first need to right click on the icon, and select 'options'.</b> Once you arrive, you have three options.
<br<
    The first is to select on of the availible cursors. The second is to click 'colors' and pick a cursor from one of 13 different colors. The third option is to paste the link to an image in the box, and then press 'other'. This will set your cursor to the image that you linked.
    <br>
  After selecting a cursor, you can preview it on the page. If you are happy with your selection, clicking 'Save Changes' will submit your selection.
    <br>
    If your have any questions or problems, you can use the support tab in the chrome webstore, or email me at bbusch.devloper@gmail.com

    Update Log
</h1>
    <h2>
        Update 3.3.0
    </h2>
    <p>
        Added Pointer Feature
    </p>
    <h2>
        Update 3.2.0!

    <p>
        In this update, I added the feature to change your cursor from within any webpage.<br>
        Simply click on the icon in the top right-hand corner, and select your cursor from there.
    </p>
<h2>
    Update 3.0.0!
</h2>
<p>
    In this new update, I have added the ability to choose from a selection of cursors, as well as the ability to use your
    own image.
    <br>
    To select a cursor, right click on the icon in the top right, and select options. Next, select a cursor and if you are
    happy with it, press Save Changes.
    <br>
    Also, I have removed my Fish Cursor extension and replaced it with a fish cursor option.
</p>


Update: In response to complaints that the extension does not work, I would like to clarify some conditions that it will
not work in.

- The Chrome Web Store. To my knowledge, no extension can change the Chrome Web Store website.
-Pages that were open when the extension was installed and have not been refreshed. You will need to refresh any open
pages for the extension to take effect.
-Any part of the screen that is not the web page. (Bookmarks bar, tabs, etc.) This is the browser, not the webpage and
can't be affected by extensions.

Hopefully, this will clear up any confusion or problems that you guys have been having. If you come across any problems,
email me or use the support section of the web store.
