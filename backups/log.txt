<h4>UPDATE 4.1.0</h4>
<p>
Added a large number of cursors, including:
Overwatch, Animals, Emoji
</p>
<h4>UPDATE 4.0.0</h4>
<p>
A long overdue update to the UI. The menu is no longer confusing, your cursor selection will now autosave, and the image uploader is now part of the popup.
</p>
<h4>UPDATE 3.3.5</h4>
<p>
Update 3.3.5 introduces a lovely material design UI update, and an image uploader. The image uploader allows you to upload images from your computer and use them as cursors.
</p>
<h4>UPDATE 3.3.4</h4>
<p>
Update 3.3.4 is the spooky halloween update adding a new cursor with a spooky surprise and an update to the popup design.
The main purpose of the design is to make way for several new designs to be added in a way that does not change the layout much.
I hope you all like it, email me at bbusch.developer@gmail.com if you find any bugs, and have a spooky halloween!k “Edit Text” or double click me to add your own content and make changes to the font. I’m a great place for you to tell a story and let your users know a little more about you.
