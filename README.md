# Custom Cursor Extension
Previously known as Rainbow Cursor.

This extension changes your cursor to one of the included options, or any hosted image (needs a url).  

Please only use the issue report feature to report bugs in the code. This is when the extension runs, but does weird things. If the extension does not run at all, or you have a sugestion, please use the chrome web store.
## Development:

## Upcoming features:
- [x] Option to upload images instead of finding a url.
- [ ] Message to refresh open tabs on install or update.
- [ ] Full color wheel allowing for the cursor to be any color value.
